SensorSafe Project: Broker (haksoo@cs.ucla.edu)

Note: Broker server does not use mongoDB.

We use Apache webserver with Django web framework w/ sqlite3 + mongoDB backend.
(sqlite3: for small stuff e.g. userinfo, mongodb: large stuff e.g. sensor data)

+ Why sqlite3 + mongoDB?

  1. Performance
    So we use mongoDB for storing large amount of data only.
    -> Our application: sensor stream data at high sample rate.

    mongoDB is good for write-intensive application.

  2. Clean Code
    But we still want to get the most out of Django's backend DB integration, e.g. user admin, so we use sqlite3.
    Also, we have fairly complex processing of "JSON" privacy rules, so it was important that they can be easily modified to mongoDB's "JSON" query language in order to write cleaner code.

+ Why Django?
  Better S/W engineering: MVC, Python. 
  Although it might be slow but our performance mostly depends on sensor data and rule processing.

+ Why Apache?
  Come on, this is de-facto standard web server!
